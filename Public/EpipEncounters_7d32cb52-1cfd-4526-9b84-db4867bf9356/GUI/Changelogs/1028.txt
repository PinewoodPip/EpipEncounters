- Added hotbar hotkeys for Toggle Party Link and bedroll rest. The rest hotkey still requires a bedroll.
- Fixed hotbar for people who did not have it enabled before this patch, or deleted their config
- Hotbar custom keyboard hotkeys are now locked behind a setting in the config file; off by default.
- Fixed custom hotbar hotkeys working even when the multihotbar was disabled
