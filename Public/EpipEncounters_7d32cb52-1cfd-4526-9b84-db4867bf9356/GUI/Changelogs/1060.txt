- Added a better frame for the hotbar health bar, and shadows for the AP bar (thanks Elric)
- Added a keybind to bring up the examine UI (the real one)
- Added all engine actions (the ones you see in the controller UI) to the hotbar actions drawer (the vanilla one, bound to `X`), except for flee
- Reordered some keybindings
- Added "Let there be tooltips" to the list of EE-incompatible mods
- Fixed character-specific context menus appearing on items
- Fixed the save/load overlay not disappearing in multiplayer when the UI is closed
- Fixed a possible edge case with walking over corpses in combat that would result in the corpse not being lootable after combat
- Fixed the dragging area for the debug display being too large
- Fixed an issue with character control switching rapidly
- Fixed hotbar tooltips not showing keybinds
- Removed the "Special Binding 1 & 2" keys since they are no longer used

On the technical side of things:

- Added data for all InputEvents to `Input` as well as possibly the world's biggest alias
- Added an `IO` table
- Began modernizing the context menu APIs
- Added a Pointer library, currently deals only with `Ext.UI.GetPickingState()`-related matters
- Added `table.lua` and `math.lua` containing the extensions to the respective built-in tables
- RGBColor creation now clamps the color values
- Implemented __eq, __add and __sub for RGBColor
- Various fixes for outdated/clashing IDE class names
- Fixed an infinite loop when using the default buttons for `MessageBox`
- Added a table for `combatTurn` UI
    - Unfortunately this UI does not appear to hold any character handles, making it not very useful.
