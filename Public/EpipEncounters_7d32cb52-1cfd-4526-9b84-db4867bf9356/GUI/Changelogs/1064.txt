- The "infinite carry weight setting" should now work properly for clients that join mid-session
	- Other features that face problems in multiplayer are possibly suffering from the same bug and will be fixed in the future
Hotbar:
- Fixed layouts being saved for summons and party followers
- Layouts should now be synchronized better in multiplayer, and survive a lua reset
- Layouts now save when the pause menu is opened, rather than when the game is paused (which basically never happens in multiplayer)
	- There's probably a dozen other features that made this mistake; they will be fixed in the future
- Reworked the settings menu and underlying system
	- The settings menu is now separate from the vanilla UI, prevent conflicts with mods that may overwrite the vanilla one
	- Settings have been reorganized into separate tabs
	- Settings are now saved per-profile, in `Osiris Data/Epip/{profile GUID}/`
- Vanity internals have been reworked, with multiple changes as a result:
	- Dyes no longer require deltamods and thus should no longer be lost to shenanigans or bloat the savefile
	- Transmogrifying no longer requires the item to be transformed and therefore should no longer have any gameplay side effects
		- As a result, you are no longer prevented from transmogrifying GB5 sets
	- Transmogrifying weapons into another type (ex. dagger -> bow) will have them show in the proper location while sheathed
	- Added an option to keep the icon while transmogrifying
	- Fixed an issue with dyes not being loaded properly from oufits
	- Added an option to hide any armor slot's visuals
		- Due to an engine quirk, changing visibility is not properly reflected in the character sheet until you switch characters
	- Your previous dyes will be lost
- Fixed icons on the minimap flickering
- The localization system now supports contextual metadata for ease of translation, and integration for it has been added to the Feature table
	- You can define TSKs in `TranslatedStrings` and query them by indexing `TSK` within the feature
	- TSKs defined this way support aliases that are valid only within the context of the feature, preventing collisions
- Added a python script to import/export Epip translation files in `Mods\EpipEncounters_7d32cb52-1cfd-4526-9b84-db4867bf9356\Story\RawFiles\Python\localization.py`
- Added `GetTurnOrder()` to Combat library
