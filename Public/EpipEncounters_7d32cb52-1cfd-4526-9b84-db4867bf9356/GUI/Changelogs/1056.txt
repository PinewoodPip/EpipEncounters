- Stats Tab:
    - Added Voracity stats
    - Added Artifacts
- Quick Examine now shows Artifacts for your allies as well (useful in multiplayer)
- Vanity: added support for "Visitors from Cyseal" mod, though it currently appears to have some issue with replacing some item icons
- Fixed a freeze with Immersive Meditation
- Fixed another grey out issue with the hotbar (skills with weapon damage but no weapon requirement)
- Fixed the category weight sliders in Epic Enemies not being saved
- Fixed the "Show Minimap" option appearing twice in the options menu
- Fixed some issues with controllers
- Skills show their IDs in tooltips in developer mode

On the technical side of things:

- Added `StopPropagation()` to the new event table
- Added a wrapper for checking developer mode, with an option to use an additional check; WIP and testing features will be locked behind it, meaning the rest of the features (like the cheats menu) can be used without problems
- Added a few new utility methods
- Started work on further giga brain hotbar improvements
