### Inventory Multi-Select
- The container inventory UI is now supported, with the same functionality as the party inventory one
- The keybinds can now be rebound, either from the keybinds tab or directly from the "Inventory" settings tab
- Dragging multiple items to the bottom slots of an inventory now works as expected, rather than stopping once visible slots are exhausted
- Fixed selecting items very quickly in the party inventory causing you to use the item
- Fixed items not being filtered properly when marked/unmarked as wares
    - Unfortunately, this requires them to be re-added to the character inventory, which will move them to the first available slot.

### World Tooltip "Open Containers" Setting
- Fixed opening containers not working when characters were close enough to the container to open it without moving
- You may now switch to a different container or cancel with left-click while moving to open one, simulating vanilla behaviour

### Other changes and additions
- Added an option to auto-listen to nearby dialogues, enabled from the "Notifications" tab (*"Auto-Listen Dialogues"* and *"Auto-Listen Range Limit"*)
    - Due to limitations with the extender, these options are only available when using [the custom build](extender.md).
- The "Toggle World Tooltips" keybind now works if the vanilla keybinding is changed, and is now possibly less janky
- Epip keybinds now support binding left-click in button chords
- Added a setting to highlight empty slots in the container inventory UI upon hovering over them, for consistency with the party inventory. Can be enabled from the "Inventory" settings tab (*"Highlight Empty Container Slots"*)

- Fixed "Book read."/"Key used." tooltips having an inconsistent appearance
- Fixed Discord Rich Presence overhaul mode when within subregions that have no name
- Fixed "Toggle World Tooltips" not re-enabling tooltips after exiting dialogue
