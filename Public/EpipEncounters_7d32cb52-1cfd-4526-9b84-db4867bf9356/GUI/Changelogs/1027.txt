This patch contains numerous fixes and the first part of the rework of hotbar hotkeys. <font color="#b8511d">Happy birthday Derpy!</font>

- Replaced the tutorials tab in the journal with a patch notes tab (the one you're reading right now!)
    - See EpipPatchNotes.lua for an example on how to use this in your own mod.
- Artifact tooltips now show "Artifact" as rarity rather than Unique

-------------------------------------------------------------

<font size="23">Hotbar Updates</font>
- Added customizable hotbar action hotkeys/buttons. Drag and drop to rearrange/assign them, right click to bring up a list of all actions. Mods can add their own actions very easily; see <b>HotbarActions.lua</b> for an example.
- To use them with keyboard keys, assign the "Hotbar Hotkey #" keys from the game's controls menu. Rebinding them will be easier in the future.
- This rework is a work-in-progress, both in terms of functionality and art; in the future there will also be a 1-row layout.
- The multihotbar is now enabled by default. Set "disableHotbar" to true in the config file to disable it.
- Deprecated the Infusion and Meditate hotkeys; please use the hotbar version of them from now on.
- Summons can no longer add hotbar rows
- All the custom elements should now hide during dialogues
- Fixed jankiness when using low resolutions

-------------------------------------------------------------

<font size="23">Fixes</font>
- Fixed player status bar sometimes clipping through portraits and appearing to the left of them
- Fixed stat adjustments tooltip not working properly on resists
- Fixed stat adjustments tooltip eating up all other boosts
- Fixed boss frame in the enemy health bar UI. It should work consistently now
- Leper rune now should properly grant the talent when it's socketed into an equipped item
- Fixed being able to infuse out-of-turn with the hotkey (rest in peace gigabrain infused reaction builds)
- Possibly disabled turn notifications on the hotbar health bar

-------------------------------------------------------------

<font size="23">Known issues</font>
- "Actions" drawer (attack/sneak/sheathe) does not work well along with the default keyboard hotkey, and the menu is not repositioned
- Buttons on the hotbar don't yet light up like they do in vanilla
- Order of actions in drawer is random
- Some hotbar buttons do not have state animations yet
- The title in the patch notes menu will not be the right color the first time after a reload (OH MY GOD)
