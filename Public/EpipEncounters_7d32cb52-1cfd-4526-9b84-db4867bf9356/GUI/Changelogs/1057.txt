- Fixed the annoying issue of control being switched to new summons in combat while it's still your turn
- Crafting UI now remembers your last tab (equipment/consumables etc.)
- Added a setting to set the default tab for the crafting UI
- The hotbar now shows a warning for unmemorized skills, as well as skills from items that have been unequipped
- Fixed some changelogs ingame not showing up
- Added an option to enable some improvements to the save/load menu: alphabetical sorting and search. The search bar supports lua patterns and is case-sensitive

On the technical side of things:

- The hotbar updates periodically again to fix some issues, and should no longer break completely when a single slot/action fails to render
