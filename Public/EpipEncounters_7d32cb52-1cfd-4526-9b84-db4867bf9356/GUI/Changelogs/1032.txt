Small patch with some QoL for dyes and a fix for a Finesse issue.

- Dyeing equipped items will now re-quip them automatically
- Changed the finesse recovery for weapon-based skills to fix an issue with delayed procs if multiple things used its logic
- Removed the option to show enemy lvl in healthbar (still buggy!)
