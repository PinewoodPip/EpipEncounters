- Added a hotkey to use the skill/item on the very last slot of your hotbar (right-most in 5th row)
	- Can use this to make a Source Vamp hotkey, for example
- Weapon range deltamods now show up like regular deltamods on the tooltip, and the weapon range display is split up to show both base and extra range
- Holding the show cones button (shift by default) will display skill damage as their multipliers
- When infusing or when the shift key is held, unmet SI requirements will be displayed in red text
- Possibly fixed the "auto-unlock inventories" feature
- Artifact items now show quality
- Added an option to log all UI ExternalInterface calls and invokes to the console, visible in the settings menu if the extender developer mode is enabled
- Started slowly organizing code into sensical libraries; anything in the extended `Game` table should be reliable and will likely not change names
- Fixed an error in the console when hovering over armor whose subtype could not be determined (ex. the starting tattered equipment)
- Character Creation UI now implements machine learning and blockchain technology to notify you of possible typos in your character names
- Added a WIP custom talents feature. See `EpipTalents.lua` for usage example.
	- Shortcomings:
	- They will only display on kb+m. No controller UI support yet.
	- They do not show up in the examine UI yet.
	- Requirements are not rechecked while moving ability/attribute points around in the mirror; upon exiting, you will lose any talents you cannot sustain
	- Can't bind them to deltamods
	- Rarely, the mirror UI might show you having fewer talent points than you do - this should fix itself if you exit the mirror and go back in (if someone has a save where this happens consistently, let me know)
- As a result of the talent UI changes, the bug with unequipping walk-it-off should be fixed
