- Replaced the config json file with an ingame settings menu, available from the game's normal "Gameplay settings" tab
- Unidentified artifacts now show their rarity as artifact, and use the custom color
- Proteans and Artifact runes now also use the Artifact color, and slots that they cannot be put on have a warning message
