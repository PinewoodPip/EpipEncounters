- Added Ctrl+C/V support to the dye tab text fields
- Fixed Epic Enemies tooltip (thanks Pancarte)
- Fixed outfits ignoring transmog restrictions
- Fixed vanity dye slider text values sometimes not moving around
- Fixed items transmogged into artifacts gaining the special tooltip color (this will require an EE Core update to fully work)

On the technical side of things:

- Cleaned up `MessageBox`
