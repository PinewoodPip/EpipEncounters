As of today, Epip is now one year old! My attention span for projects tends to be very low (as evidenced by my other EE stuff), but Epip looks to be an exception to that and it's incredible what it has become - all its UI changes were nearly unimaginable just a year ago. Thank you all for the support throughout the months, even at times when the patches were a buggy mess.

Just like the initial release of the mod on April 1st, this anniversary patch is very real, and best experienced on this day of the month.

Changelog:

- Pressing escape while in the EE UIs now backs out of them rather than bring up the pause menu
- The stats tab now shows damage dealt and received in the current fight (or previous fight, when out of combat)
- Added a new bug to the character sheet
- Performance improvements to the hotbar
- Gold/Splinter counter in the stats tab should now be more reliable
- Minor technical changes to make the mod compatible with Descent
- Added a scrollbar to the hotbar buttons drawer
- The hotbar now goes below the inventory and character sheet
- Hotbar cooldown animations should now be smoother
- Fixed bugs with unbinding actions in the hotbar, as well as clearing unmemorized slots
- Fixed muted characters not having their slots greyed out in hotbar
- You can now activate your Epip Encounters license ingame from the options menu
- Tooltips can now be scrolled on one axis with the mouse wheel
- The punisher now drops MicroBossâ„¢ loot to make him feel more optional
- Added a cinematic camera option, on by default
- Reworked the vanity feature: it now opens a custom tab in your character sheet. Browsing templates is a lot more convenient this way. Saved outfits are now categorized by race & gender (doesn't stop you from applying them to anyone though)
	- It wouldn't be an Epip patch if something didn't ship unfinished, which is why I must announce that the promised feature to mark templates as favorite did not make it in.

**On the technical side of things:**

- Added an alias for the `Ext` table to make it easier to type
- Fixed more inconsistencies with copy/paste in the message boxes
- Added an option to log AI scoring to the console: the top 3 actions will be shown anytime decisions are made. Work-in-progress as some of the AI features in the extender are currently bugged.

- Tooltips for Ascension stats in the stats tab are now created dynamically, so there's no need to edit them if you've edited the description/name
- Added a `Server` table on the client, from which listeners for any Osiris symbol can be created, eliminating the need for boilerplate code on the server side if you need to listen for Osiris stuff.
- Added an `Osiris` table on server to make user queries and DB queries a bit less aids to use in lua:
