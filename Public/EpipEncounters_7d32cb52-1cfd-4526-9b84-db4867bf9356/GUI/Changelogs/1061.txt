- Added new settings for world item tooltips:
    - Emphasizing containers, consumables and/or equipment by changing their color
        - This setting will not work for items that would result in a crime upon interaction; they will remain red.
    - Enabling world tooltips for all items (similar to the "Let there be tooltips" mod)
    - Filtering out clutter (particularly the one added by the setting above): chairs, doors, non-interactable items
    - Option to open containers upon clicking their tooltip, rather than picking them up

- Added an option to exit the chat UI after sending a message (so you don't need to press escape manually)
- Added an option to disable notifications for sharing civils ("X shares Loremaster/LC with Z")
- Searching saves is now case-insensitive
- Added a ping counter to the debug display
    - Since the server only responds to net messages once per game tick, the counter will basically always show around 33ms in singleplayer

- Fixed "Show empty containers/bodies" not actually working on items
- Fixed another case of an infinite loop of switching characters
- Fixed the "toggle world tooltips" keybind not working (+ crashing the game)
- Fixed some character sheet tooltips appearing in the vanity UI

On the technical side of things:
- Osiris library now converts boolean values to integer in calls
- Added `HasFlag()`, `IsContainer()` to Item library
- Added initial groundwork for an inventory expansion
