- Added an option to show artifact/protean chances on enemy health bars when the "Show Sneak Cones" (shift by default) key is held. Also works on containers, without needing the key to be held. 
- Fixed an issue with some setup event being unreliable (likely the source of many hotbar problems)
- Fixed some events being fired once per user
- Fixed equip animations in the character sheet
- Client timers are now truly client-side
    - As a result hotkey'd skills on the hotbar should now have a lot less delay
- Fixed hotbar not being greyed out for dead characters
- Fixed "None"-type weapons not being considered melee, causing incarnate bull rush to appear grayed out in the hotbar
- Fixed another large performance issue with the stats tab
