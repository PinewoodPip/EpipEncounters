- Animation cancelling now has 2 modes: client-side (v1065 behaviour) and server-side (old behaviour). The server-side option uses the lower delay that was used previously.
- Changed how hotbar row count and visibility is saved
    - This might not work in multiplayer due to extender shenanigans
- Custom status UI elements are now bigger (ex. in Quick Examine)
- Added a new rune crafting system; simply right-click a rune material and select the new option in the dropdown menu to get started.
- Reworked the stats tab; should be less prone to bugging out in multiplayer now
    - Also fixed the gold & splinter stat
- The incompatible mods warnings now show on every load, rather than once per playthrough
- Updated localizations and added Brazilian Portuguese, translated by Ferocidade
- Character sheet skew during anniversaries is now less extreme
- Removed the "cinematic combat" option

Fixes:

- Fixed some log spam related to status icons
- Fixed hotbar loadouts not working
- Non-english languages should no longer have broken artifact descriptions
    - The cause was fetching the TSKs during module load, which causes a bug that overwrites the string.
- Fixed Quick Examine not being openable for the same character twice in a row
- Fixed vanity dyes not applying to slots that vanilla armor (without transmog) would hide/mask
- Fixed error if an item was transmogged into a template that no longer existed
- Fixed a typo in the settings to fix Astrologer's Gaze tooltip
