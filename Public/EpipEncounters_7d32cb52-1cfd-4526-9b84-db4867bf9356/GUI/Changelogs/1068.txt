This patch contains various fixes for older features, as well as a few new requested features.

### Vanity
- Transmogging should now correctly use the "masks" of the chosen appearance
    - This fixes incorrect behaviour when using items or transmogs that hid other item slots (ex. dresses hiding gloves or leggings)
- Fixed "Lock appearance" not working correctly for off-hand weapons
- The "built-in" dyes tab is now sorted alphabetically, and uses more human-readable names
- You no longer need to remove transmog to drill items
- Fixed the "built-in" tab only displaying item colors used by armor
- Fixed a regression from the last patch related to racial skill cooldowns that would break transmogging for undead characters
- Fixed character sheet icons not being updated when transmogging items with "Lock appearance"

### Enemy Health Bar
- Added a setting to control when and how resistances are displayed under the bar, accessed from the "General" tab (*"Resistances Display"*)
    - It's now possible to only show non-0 resistances, or show them all but only if any are not 0, or hide them entirely
    - Defaults to the previous behaviour (displaying all resistances at all times)
- Various strings displayed there are now translatable (aggro status, stat acronyms, level label)

### Other changes and additions
- Added a setting to display item tooltips in inventory UIs to the sides of the UI rather than by the cursor, accessible from the "Tooltips" tab (*"Inventory Item Tooltips Position"*)
- Added settings to control the delay before item and item comparison tooltips display in the inventory UIs, accessed from the "Tooltips" tab (*"Inventory Item Tooltip Delay"* and *"Item Comparison Tooltip Delay"*)
- The tooltips for weapon range deltamods are now translatable, and the tooltip itself should now also work for non-EE deltamods

### Other fixes
- Fixed the tooltip for the "Filtered Statuses" setting not specifying it affects the Alternative Status Display only
- Fixed the "Display B/H on player portraits" and "Escape Key Closes EE UIs" settings displaying if EE was not enabled
- Statuses in the enemy health bar will no longer overlap with the B/H indicator if there is no text displayed below the bar
- Fixed equipped items being unequipped when drag-and-dropping them into the Greatforge
- The Alternative Status Display and Settings Menu are now positioned correctly if the `UIScaling` game setting is not 1
- The settings menu is now repositioned when opening it, adjusting the positioning if the resolution was changed
- The "Quick Swap" option to access Quick Find is no longer displayed on items that cannot be unequipped (ex. Source Collars)
- Possibly fixed the party wheel menu not working in splitscreen
