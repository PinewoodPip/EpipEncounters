- Added keybinds for the debug teleport (no longer uses the ping key)
- Custom keybinds no longer fire while in dialogue

Vanity:

- Added a button to delete custom dyes
- Switching characters no longer closes the UI
- The current tab is remembered when switching items through the context menu
- Added a toggle to prevent the sliders from being set to the item's current color (makes it easier to reuse a dye on multiple items)
- Added fields to enter colors in hexadecimal
- Added buttons to copy/paste colors
- Added buttons to import/export dyes to/from the clipboard
- Sliders can now detect the default color of an item that hasn't been dyed before
- Added a checkbox to auto-transmog equipped items to your old item's appearance **while the UI is not open** (so you can switch out items in the UI without needing to toggle it off)
- Fixed the Vanity option appearing on non-equipped items

On the technical side of things:

- Added support for dev-only keybinds
- Moved `Flash` table to `Client`
- Added a `Color` table
- Created a github repository: https://github.com/PinewoodPip/EpipEncounters/commits/main
