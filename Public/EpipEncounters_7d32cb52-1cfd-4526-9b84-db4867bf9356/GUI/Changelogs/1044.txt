Rewrote the hotbar UI. This involves mostly technical changes, in preparations for a standalone release.

**Your hotkey keybindings will be reset with this update! Please bind them again.**

Visible changes:

- Fixed the top of the buttons area blocking clicks onto the world and other UIs
- Any skill or item can now be dragged from the hotbar to the customizable buttons to bind it there (useful for old mods that use skills/items to bring up menus)
	- The "use last slot" action has been removed due to this.
- Removed the "view changelog" action
- The slot rendering is now entirely scripted (no help from the engine) which works around a crash and removes the need for an initialization procedure (that annoying "switch to the first row" message)
- Saving your current amount of bars and order should be a lot more reliable (now happens upon pausing the game, instead of a timer)
- Action buttons can now be highlighted or disabled; ex. the pyramids one is disabled if the party has no pyramids
- Added an action to open the pyramids UI
- Fixed the source skill border clipping into other rows
- Added compatibility for Weapon Expansion: adds an action for toggling the menu, and repositions the original button when you have 2 rows of action buttons
- Actions in the drawer are now ordered in a consistent manner
- Added a context menu when you right click a row; from there, you can:
	- "Push" groups of slots to the left/right (useful for inserting skills inbetween slots)
	- Clear rows, or unmemorized skills
	- Save and load "loadouts" of rows. Loadouts can be applied even if your character doesn't currently know all the skills from it.

Other changes:

- Simple tooltips (the ones that go in that very small black box) now appear much faster, rather than being delayed
- Added numerous calls to `Game.Character` and `Game.Item`, mostly related to functionality needed for the hotbar.

#### Technical stuff so it doesn’t look like I’m doing nothing:

- Rewrote character sheet resistances script
- Rewrote script for enemy health bar
- Moved Majora’s compatibility to its own script
- Added Game.Character library for character-related stuff

- Numerous miscellaneous internal changes

### 27/12/21:

- Updated to v56 of the extender. Current issues (with the extender):
    - Anything related to status tooltip editing does not work as Game.Tooltip is borked
    - UIs with custom icons (hotbar, toolip) stop displaying vanilla icons after the first session. Custom icons are disabled for now so as to keep both the hotbar and console usable
- Removed the old console cheats
- Full rewrite of the stats tab; it should be a lot more reliable now (especially in multiplayer) and survives lua resets
- Stats and categories are now defined in Epip.Features.StatsTab.
- Fixed context menu not working on chained characters, and added it to summon portraits
- (maybe) fixed summon portrait display issues
- Custom talents now display in the examine menu
- Organizational changes to tooltip adjustments script
- torturerSkillOverrides was moved to Data.Game.TORTURER_SKILL_OVERRIDES
- statusToSkill was moved to Data.Game.DAMAGING_STATUS_SKILLS
