    Welcome to Epip Encounters:tm: by PinewoodPip !!!
    Feel free to browse the code to learn how things are implemented,
    however, you are NOT permitted to reuse it for your own projects.
    Using it as a dependency for your own EE mod is fine.

    The plan is to eventually release Epip's client/UI APIs as a standalone mod with no EE
    dependency.
    It is not my intention to hold modding systems and discoveries "hostage" to EE.
    It takes a lot of time to figure things out, implement them,
    and further time to make and document APIs that I'd deem usable by others.
    I would prefer to release Epip publicly only when it meets my quality standards.
    Please understand.

    If there is a particular feature in EE that you're interested in implementing in your own mod, contact me and I can guide you on how it was engineered. <3

    Huge thanks to the EE community, without whom I would've never gotten this far into modding this game.
