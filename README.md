### Issues & PRs
The [Epic Encounters discord server](https://discord.gg/SevYmQc573) has a dedicated channel (`#epipeline`) for Epip development where issues and features can be discussed. Nightly/test builds are also posted there.

The GitHub issues board is not used much internally, but you can report issues there too if discord is to be avoided.
